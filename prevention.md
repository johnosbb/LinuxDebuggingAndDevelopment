# Prevention Strategies

Some good practices can allow you to save time before even needing to use a debugger. Compiler are now smart enough to detect a wide range of errors at compile-time
using warnings so using -Werror -Wall -Wextra is recommended if possible to catch errors as early as possible.

Compilers now offer static analysis capabilities, for example, GCC allows to do so using the -fanalyzer flag.
